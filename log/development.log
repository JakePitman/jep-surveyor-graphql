summary:
  When calling RatingQuestion.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): 5c77873d2355da99fedb5b90 ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: 5c77873d2355da99fedb5b90.
resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

message:
  Attempted to set a value for 'tag' which is not allowed on the model RatingQuestion.
summary:
  Without including Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic in your model and the attribute does not already exist in the attributes hash, attempting to call RatingQuestion#tag= for it is not allowed. This is also triggered by passing the attribute to any method that accepts an attributes hash, and is raised instead of getting a NoMethodError.
resolution:
  You can include Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic if you expect to be writing values for undefined fields often.

message:
  Document(s) not found for class RatingQuestion with id(s) 5cc695182355da0d1ec5e2db.
summary:
  When calling RatingQuestion.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): 5cc695182355da0d1ec5e2db ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: 5cc695182355da0d1ec5e2db.
resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.

        Failed to implement Question.id, tried:

        - `Types::QuestionType#id`, which did not exist
        - `TrueClass#id`, which did not exist
        - Looking up hash key `:id` or `"id"` on `true`, but it wasn't a Hash

        To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos)

message:
  Invalid option :null provided for field :title.
summary:
  Mongoid requires that you only provide valid options on each field definition in order to prevent unexpected behaviour later on.
resolution:
  When defining the field :title on 'RatingQuestion', please provide valid options for the field. These are currently: as, default, identity, label, localize, fallbacks, association, pre_processed, subtype, type, overwrite. If you meant to define a custom field option, please do so first like so:

   Mongoid::Fields.option :null do |model, field, value|
     # Your logic here...
   end
   class RatingQuestion
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :title, null: true
   end

        Failed to implement Survey.questions, tried:

        - `Types::SurveyType#questions`, which did not exist
        - `Survey#questions`, which did not exist
        - Looking up hash key `:questions` or `"questions"` on `#<Survey:0x00007f98f9dd05b0>`, but it wasn't a Hash

        To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos)
